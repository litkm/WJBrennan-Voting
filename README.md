# WJBrennan-Voting

The inspiration for this project came from lesson 8 of Prof. Wolfgang Alschner's course, Data Science for Lawyers (https://www.datascienceforlawyers.org/learning-resources/lesson-8/). 

This lesson uses machine learning to make predictions regarding a judge's voting record. It involves a dataset that contains Justice Brennan's SCOTUS voting record from the 1950s-1980s.

This project uses a deep learning model adapted from the classification project in unit 4 of Codecademy's skills path, Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow. 

Files:

* WJBrennan-Voting - 3 layer neural network, randomly splits the dataset into testing and training sets
* WJBrennan_1980s_Testing - 4 layer deep neural network, splits dataset so that 1980s data is used for testing
* WJBrennan_voting - CSV dataset from Prof. Alschner's course
